# 📊 Insurance Analytics Dashboard — Power BI Project

## 🔹 #ProjectOverview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Power BI Insurance Analytics Dashboard** built to transform manual insurance reporting into an automated, interactive, and secure analytics solution.

The dashboard enables business users to monitor policy performance, analyze claims, and drill down into specific policy segments while maintaining performance and data security using **Incremental Refresh** and **Row Level Security (RLS)**.

---

## 🎯 #BusinessUseCase

Traditional insurance reports often rely on manual processes and full data refresh cycles, leading to:

- Slow report generation  
- High manual effort  
- Static insights  
- No secure user-level data restriction  

This solution was designed to:

- Automate and speed up report refresh  
- Reduce manual reporting time  
- Enable self-service analytics  
- Support deep-dive policy & claim analysis  
- Enforce role-based data visibility
